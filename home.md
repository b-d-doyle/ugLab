$\mu$g-Lab (the Microgravity Laboratory) is a research group at Auburn University led by Uwe Konopka. The primary purpose of this page is to make sharing and organizing resources easier within the group. But we should probably have a bit of outward-facing stuff, in case someone else stumbles upon this somehow.
