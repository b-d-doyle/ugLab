# COMPACT

COMPACT is a DLR-led next-generation space-flight experiment under development, with a tentative launch date of 2029.

Here at $\mu$g-Lab, we are constructing a ground science reference chamber to support the COMPACT microgravity campaigns. This page will be updated as development progresses.
