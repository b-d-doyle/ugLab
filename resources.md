# Resources
## Restricted links
Some things you should need to be specifically invited to view. The access is controlled at the link location, so Box, github, etc.
 - Data
 - The group burn book (a la Mean Girls)
 - closed github repos
 - etc.

## Auburn Box links
Anyone with an AU account can access these. I suggest this level of access for things undergrads in our lab can pull up via QR code.
